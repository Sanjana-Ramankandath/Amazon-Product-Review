# Amazon Product Review Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the customer review data set of Amazon products. The dataset has > 20K records with
several columns including product ratings, submission date, category etc., Using this data set, I analyzed 
the top reviewed product categories, how each product is rated based on it's description, pattern in which each item is sold 
and finally how these categories compete against each other with respect to the user-ratings.
